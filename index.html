               <!-- <img id = "pfp" src = "images/syd.png">-->
                <p> I am a computer science major with a HCI specialization at the University of Rochester. Currently I am a Sophomore and am taking classes in Artificial Intelligence and Web Design, both of which I am very interested in! I am particularly interested in making advanced and sophisticated technologies accessible to everyone so that their impact can be even greater. 
                I am looking for a internship this summer in the computer science field and also hoping to get involved in HCI research soon!
            My hobbies include digital design, crafting, snowboarding, watching documentaries, learning about the world around me, and more.
            </p>

            <h4> Stuff I do:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> I am a computer science teaching assistant which allows me to use my skills to help teach others about CS. Two days a week I run a lab of 50 students with two other lab TAs. I also grade 15+ labs a week and help the professor with grading midterm and final exams. It also has made my debugging skills much better because sometimes my job entails looking at code and find the bug thats making it not work. 
                </li>
                <li> I also work at Rettner Digital Media Lab where I can further develop my interests in digital media. The lab has lots of resources from 3D printing to virtual reality equipment that I help people with and also get to use! 
                </li>
                <li>
                    I recently started an Etsy shop where I sell some of my digital creations in the form of digital notebooks and digital stickers. Check out some of my designs <a href="#design"> here. </a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    I am also working on an app as a project manager and designer to which combines my interests of digital design with my career interests. To see some basic design and UX development for the app go to: 
                </li>
                <li>
                    I am a studio art minor so I get to fulfill my creative needs through that. I am currently taking sculpture and it has let me develop a lot of creative problem solving skills that can be applied to anything.
                </li>
                <li>
                        I am also a psychology minor because I am very interested in creating technologies to help people and studying psychology can help me do that. The psychology I learn has direct implications to HCI and I am excited to be able to use the ideas I learn in my psych classes and computer science classes to create technologies that make the world a better place.

            <h3> Computer Science </h3>
            <h4> Relevant Coursework: </h4>
            <ul>
                <li> Human Computer Interaction</li>
                <li> Tools for Data Science </li> 
                <li> Advanced Front End Web Design and Development </li> 
                <li> Artifical Intelligence</li>

                <li> Discrete Mathmatics </li>
            </ul>
            <h4> Projects I've worked on: </h4>
            <ul>
                <li> Connect Four AI: My most recent project for Artificial Intelligence was creating a connect four AI that plays well enough to beat humans. It was a really exciting project because I find the minimax algorithm along with other search methods to be extremely interesting. It is also a great feeling to write a program that is better then I am at connect four. 
                </li>
                <li>
                        In Computation and Formal Models I completed many projects including creating DFAs, NFAs, Recursive and table driven parsers for grammars, functional programming, implementing our own relational data model, and more. This was the first theory heavy computer science class I took and it was challenging but I found it very interesting and a very rewarding class to take. 
                </li>
                <li>
                        In Data Structures and Algorithms I worked on projects ranging from using Dijkstras algorithm to find the shortest path between any two points in New York state, creating 2048, creating a calculator that functions the way using python as a calculator would, and using Huffman encoding to compress a image and then decompress it. The Huffman coding project was my favorite because it was really cool to be able to take a file, encode it then decode it and have the same file again! 
                </li>
                <li>
                        I have also made a website with a partner that took a huge set of data and helped people find the closest farmers market to them with lots of information about the farmers market and had the ability to search for specific things. We did this website for the Young Rewired State of Code hackathon and ended up getting first place in the international category. 
                </li>
                <li>
                        I have also worked on creating versions of fix it felix (in java) and frogger (in javascript) 
                </li>
                <li>
                        I made a website in high school that used another large data file and allowed the user to search up any restaurant in NYC and see its history of health code ratings and violations. It was one of my first more serious computer science projects and I am still proud of it! 
                </li>
                <li>
                        I am currently working on an app as a project manager and UX designer. More about this project will be added as it develops.
